//Pseudocode
//generate dynamic buttons from js script
//list of buttons are populated from an array
//loop over array to create dynamic buttons
	//each button queries GIPHY API of a particular Disney character
	//clicking on a button to pull 10 images from Giphy API	
	//initally loaded gifs are still
	//Each gif has a rating
	//Click on a gif to make it animate
	//Click again to make image still
//Create a form that inputs text representing a Disney character
//Submitting a value will:
	//generate a dynamic button
	//query the Giphy API for that character
	//pull 10 still gifs of that character
	//each gif has a rating
	//clicking on a gif will animate it
	//clicking it again will make it still
